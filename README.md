A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.
In this repository, I submit a sample of bank account and the tests. It supports opening an account, withdrawing,
depositing. The bank balance has been initialized to zero and its such that 
the initial balance on an account is zero. This means that someone cannot find money on a newly opened accout.
It also supports sequential deposit and withdrawal from an account. And when an account is closed, individuals cannot access it.
